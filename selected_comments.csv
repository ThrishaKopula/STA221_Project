Each side has 120 balls or 10 outs(wickets) whichever comes first to get the highest score they can. 

Now since each side only has one chance the team that goes second is ""chasing"" the first teams high score ( you dont need to keep playing if you get 1 more run than the first team).

Winning by 22 runs is a pretty good result it means that the chasing team fell short by those 22 runs. Chases can and often are much tighter and therefore more exciting. 

When it's 2 balls left and they need 6 more runs it's much more exciting.

I do not think an Al Gore presidency would have had the housing market crash. The root symptoms of the cause would not have had time to develop.

While COVID would likely have occurred regardless, we can look to states with robust COVID responses who fared far better than others on their comeback. The US's vaccination policy was extremely helpful in righting the economy. Any president who had leant into the vaccinations and safety would have helped the economy recover. Trump just refused to do that (despite being poised to).

There are also other scenarios that might force fighters to a merge, whether or not they attempt to kill each other along the way.

* Fighters can run out of missiles. Depending on the mission and the acceptable risk, it may be a requirement that fighters exercise every possible option to succeed. If the threat is overwhelming and missiles expended, that might mean choosing the highest priority target and going for a guns kill. Remember [during 9/11 that unarmed fighters escorting an airliner considered the possibility they'd have to collide with the airliner's control surfaces](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/f-16-pilot-was-ready-to-give-her-life-on-sept-11/2015/09/06/7c8cddbc-d8ce-11e0-9dca-a4d231dfde50_story.html).
* ROE might require that a threat is assessed up close before employing.
* Systems aren't 100% effective. Missiles can fail in a myriad of ways, sensors can drop lock. The intelligence could be inadequate such that a weapons system optimized in the wrong way. Enemy tech could receive updates between development of a weapon and deployment into the real world.
* Aircrew make mistakes. Employing a weapon against a single target isn't just a ""select and fire"" kind of task. Between starting up and troubleshooting systems, choosing the appropriate targets, flying the right flight profiles, setting up the weapons for employment, checking to make sure all those parameters are sound, and flying profiles and managing systems through impact while maintaining battlefield awareness and simultaneously executing defenses against the threat... there are hundreds of datapoints that a pilot is referencing, real-time, just to shoot one missile at one target.

They already had excellent trade routes to the South and to India, where all the good trade goods came from. (Remember, Colombus was looking for a shorter route to the East, not places to colonize.)   


China and Japan were heavily regimented societies. The rulers of Japan discouraged people leaving Japan. The Emperors of China were definitely not interested in establishing colonies they couldn't control at the other end of an ocean. They had all that land out West that they could conquer (when they had the money) where the best horses came from.
